# The Plan

The plan is to create a GraphQL API that fulfills all requirements set out in the spec. We'll be using Postgres, TypeORM, Express, Jest,

# What I'd do differently

- Migrations: For time's sake, I used typeorm in sync mode.
- Api Documentation: More thorough api documentation. Currently just basic swagger docs.
